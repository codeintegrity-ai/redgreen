## AI Code Generation Guidelines

- **Think twice before generating**: Consider all implications and requirements before writing code.
- **Make small, incremental changes**: Get approval before proceeding to the next change.
- **Keep code under 10 lines**: Break down complex solutions into smaller parts.
- **Prioritize simplicity**: Simple, readable code is better than clever, complex code.
- **Use existing patterns**: Match the style and approach of the surrounding codebase.
- **Focus on one task at a time**: Solve specific problems rather than making large-scale changes.
- **Provide clear explanations**: Explain the reasoning behind implementation choices.
- **Handle errors explicitly**: Don't use fallbacks; throw clear errors that can be caught.
- **Use strict types only**: Maintain TypeScript's type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Remove redundant code**: Don't duplicate existing functionality or leave dead code.
